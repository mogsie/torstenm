<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I had looked at the opportunity and traveled to Copenhagen to
enter Aas Agricultural College, to update my (lack of) maths knowledge with my
former friends from the maths department from Gl Hellerup. But it didn't
captivate me, so I started looking at the job ads in the Berlinger, and found
something that really tempted me; Northern Soft and Hardwood (Dalhoff Larsen
&amp; Hornemann - DL&amp;H) was looking for an employee who could speak French
and who had forestry - timber experience (had splinters in his fingers) for the
office in Abidjan on the Ivory Coast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>So I </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>borrowed my father's old Underwood typewriter,
applied, was called for an interview, and got the job among 12 candidates, so I
was in seventh heaven. I was employed in March 1963, worked a bit at the head
office in Copenhagen and at their sawmill in Roskilde, until leaving for
Abidjan in April.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>DL&amp;H arranged tickets for me and Director Bjørn Jensen,
who had set up several of the company's coastal offices (Abidjan in the Ivory
Coast, Takoradi in Ghana, Douala in Cameroun and Libreville in Gabon) but it
was in the old days around the time when the various countries in Africa kicked
out the colonial powers (for 60 </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>years) Ivory Coast (Cote
d'Ivoire) became an independent republic in 1960 under President Houphouet Boigny,
who had previously served as a minister in Charles de Gaulle's government.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I arrived in 1963 on a SAS Caravelle to Copenhagen and then
with Air Afrique to Abidjan. There John Hornemann (son of the top manager of
DL&amp;H) managed the office where Thomsen and I were buyers and a
Moroccan/French secretary and accountant. In the port there were 6 employed
Africans from Haute Volta (now Burkina Fasso). Their tasks were to verify that
the logs that Thomsen or I had received up in the jungle had all arrived. The
logs were from 1 ton and up to about 10-12 tons depending on the type of wood.
Each log was numbered and marked with the supplier and classified as either A,
B or C quality, allowing us to put together lots in accordance with the orders
of our various customers around the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The rule in DL&amp;H was that colleagues were referred to by </span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>their </span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>surname
and Vous's, not Tu's. Thomsen and I shared a villa with a night guard armed
with a bow, arrow and spear, paid by the company, and a houseboy, paid by us.
He kept the house tidy, washed clothes, shopped and cooked for us two 25 </span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>-year-old
Scandinavians. We each had our suppliers around the bush, whom we visited when
they had collected enough timber to justify a trip into the jungle. So there
was a lot of driving! I was handed a well-used Citroën 2 CV, which I used well
for the first six months. It didn't go that fast, but I had a good time with
it, and kept up with the timber trucks on flat land! I was the only Norwegian
in Abidjan, sponsored by the Swedish consulate. It turned out that the Braastad
family from Oppland ran a large pineapple plantation some distance outside
Abidjan, but they were rarely in town.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>But in 1964, the Norwegian government upgraded the diplomatic
connection to an embassy. With ambassador, First Secretary, and a young lady as
embassy secretary named Benny Brinch, with responsibilities including for
communication and mail to the Norwegian freight schooners that visited the
harbor regularly (SWAL, Hoegh-line and Wilhelmsen-lines). As I was the only
Norwegian in the city, and thus the Norwegian colony, I was invited to many of
the embassy's events, and gradually got to know Benny, who was 3 years younger
than me, well.</span></p>

<p class="img"><img src="./img/patrick-torsten.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>But Benny found a French wood buyer named Patrick Bernard, </span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>so I
eventually became a kind of third wheel, and concentrated on my job. In the
meantime, I had been upgraded from a 2CV to a Peugeot 403, which I drove about
50,000 km per year, inspecting and purchasing the timber lots that were ready
from the various manufacturers, French, Lebanese and Danish (Palle Ravn)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Thomsen and I eventually got to know our competitors of
different nationalities, French, Dutch, English, German and Danish, who were
all aged 25-35, and they were all on first names (tu's). Then one lively
evening at the stock cafe in the harbor, after a year one of the others asked:
Why are you two on your last name between you, and all the rest of us are on
our first name? (you're). We looked at each other, slightly bemused, and said:
&quot;Company policy!&quot; They had a good laugh and said: Stuff company
policy, here in the harbor we are all on first names! So we drank tu's and we
wondered how John Hornemann would take this. The next morning, when he
discovered that we were on first names and you's, he turned red at the top and
said he shouldn't have any of that. We explained the situation, that all the
rest of the timber industry in Abidjan was on a first name basis and said that
we could not be both one and the other, so we continued to be tu's. But vous’s
with Hornemann and his wife! And others who visited us from HK.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The first secretary at the embassy, who was a few years older
than me, and a keen sportsman, suggested one day that the two of us should try
to climb &quot;Le dent de Man&quot;, the Ivory Coast's highest mountain, about
700 km NW of Abidjan. It was tempting, so we set off, spent the night en route
and began the ascent through the jungle the next morning. And suddenly we are
at the top, about 1000 m above sea level, but still dense jungle. So the view
was rather limited. And it was my only mountain climbing in the three years I
was in the Ivory Coast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Otherwise, there was a lot of driving on dirt roads, through
villages, often with chickens, which would definitely cross the road in front
of the car. Some made it, others didn't. One day on my way back from the bush
to Abidjan, a huge snake suddenly crossed the road in front of me. It was
longer than the road was wide, and I saw neither head nor tail of it. Then I
thought, now or never, a real trophy from Africa, and stepped on the gas,
floored the brake when I got to the snake, backed over it for safety, and was
about to open the door to get the machete from the trunk. As I was about to
open the door, with the window open, I saw a huge snake's head waddling back
and forth over the engine box, so I slammed the door shut, rolled up the window
and thought: what now. But the snake had had enough and slid (it seemed)
effortlessly into the bush. So it came with horror for both it and me! But
maybe it had a bit of a pain in the back?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I had an 8 mm narrow film camera, but there was no time for
either that or a photo. But I still have a lot of recordings from national
holidays in Abidjan and from the logging operation in the bush.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Once I was invited to our office in Takoradi in Ghana. The
journey took place on an English freighter with timber, with accommodation on
board. Good catering with wine or beer. That was not the case on Norwegian ships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>In the office in Takoradi, they mostly processed the same
types of wood that we had in Abidjan, but there were no timber trucks. All the
timber came by rail, up to the port in Takoradi from various collection points
in the bush. And the railway was nationalised. That is, monopolized. And with
monopoly comes corruption. My colleagues in Ghana had to negotiate with the
station master at the port for the required number of wagons for their timber.
The station master had a nice desk with a continuous drawer. After some
negotiation, they agreed on the price, and our man had to put the cash in the
drawer, which was quickly withdrawn so the boss could count the amount.
Occasionally he said that there was a shortage of wagons, but that he could get
more for an extra amount! So he lived well on his missing wagons!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>We didn't have those problems in Abidjan. No monopoly, no
corruption (back then). If you were stopped for speeding by the police, you had
to pay cash against a receipt. If you tried to negotiate the fine, it was noted
as an attempt to bribe an official, and the fine increased !!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>On a trip in the bush where all three of us boys were with us
(Hornemann was driving) we suddenly came face to face with a large heavy road
scraper at a bend on the narrow dirt road, with the driver standing behind the
wheel singing in a wild cloud. So it came to an abrupt halt for both cars, the
road scraper unharmed, but the Peugeot had received a dent, but we were all
unharmed. It was before the seat belt time. It happened just outside a village,
so the police arrived quickly, and gave the scraper driver a couple on the side
of the head with his sandal, before we were escorted back to the village, where
the car was fixed and we spent the night, before returning to Abidjan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The working day for wood buyers was long, hot and humid. The
annual temperature was between 30 and 35 degrees C with a humidity of 90-95%,
except for about two weeks around Christmas time, when the wind shifted to the
north, with the Hamadan from the Sahara and the Savannah. Then you could hear
people reading the newspaper! It crackled so it was a joy! Otherwise it was as
silent as a wet rag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>We had to be in the port at 07.00 to receive the timber
together with our African employees. The woods were generally Acajou
(mahogany), Tiama (mahogany substitute), Samba (for plywood) and Assamela (teak
substitute, especially for load-bearing elements) and occasionally Nyangon
(precious wood in general). Lunch and siesta from 12 – 15 and back in the
harbor from 15-19, Monday to Saturday. Sunday morning from 07.00 until lunch.
So 6 ½ days per week = 59 hour week. All meals were prepared and served by our
houseboy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The days in the harbor were naturally interrupted by the
buying trips up into the bush, once or twice a week. It was 400 – 700 km each
time. Sometimes you spent the night at the mill, and it was always very
pleasant. No A/C, but natural drafts from the jungle through the mosquito net,
and always exciting food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>One day Benny asked me if I could / would be a bodyguard for 2
girls from the British Embassy, since the English Red Cross had donated 3 Land
Rovers to the Red Cross in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Fasso (formerly
Upper Volta), which were to be driven from Abidjan to Ouagadougou, about 1000
km. I got permission, so we set off, three African drivers and the two English
embassy secretaries and I northwards, first on tarmac (1/3 of the way) then
jungle and savannah roads. The cars were naturally not air-conditioned, so we
drove with the windows open. We passed through Yamasoukrou, then a small
village, now the capital of Côte d'Ivoire. Later Ferkessedougou on the border
of the savannah, where we spent the night in a hotel. The girls and I each got
our own room with a shower, and had to go through the shower three times to get
dust-free! We visited the market and I found a home-woven and sewn rug with
drawings of turtles and fish. The drawings were made on the carpet lying on the
ground, covered with clay, the motifs scratched with a stick, and then covered
with thin liquid tar. When the clay was dry, the whole thing was shaken and the
drawings emerged in a dark brown colour. It's still hanging on the wall here in
Cazouls!</span></p>

<p class="img"><img src="./img/fishes.jpg"></p>


<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The next day we continued across the border to Haute Volta,
across the savannah via Bobo Dialasso before arriving in Ouagadougou late in
the afternoon, where the Red Cross received us with great ceremony. The next
day we were driven to the railway station and given a seat in 1st class on the
36-hour trip back to Abidjan, with a diesel-electric locomotive and a short
length of rail. So it sounded like we were driving at 120 km/h, but it took 36
hours. Without air conditioning, so we got dusty here too !!!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Benny and Patrick were more and more together, and one day in
1965, Benny asked me if I would be Patrick's groomsman, as they wanted to get
engaged on one of the Hoegh-line boats that came regularly to Abidjan. I
happily said yes, because I had the best impression of Patrick. The engagement
party on board the Hoegh boat with Captain Henningsen was a great success (and
the relationship is still going on in 2021!). In particular, &quot;Coca Cola de
Norvege&quot; became very popular (Lysholm Linje Akvavitt). Fortunately, there
were no alcohol tests at the time in Abidjan!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Eventually the time for my summer vacation in 1966 approached.
I had planned to return with Air Afrique, but Braastad (the pineapple producer)
suggested that I could fly with his friend Monsieur Puibaraud in his Cessna
206, 6-seater, single-engine, high-wing private plane from Abidjan to Billund
in Denmark, where his wife came from. He had a French Air Force fighter pilot
with him as co-pilot; This was exciting, so I agreed and canceled the jet plane
ticket. It's not every day you get such an offer.</span></p>

for an overhaul, but it turned out that the battery charger was misadjusted,
and overcharged the battery, so it got hot, and lost water !!! Thus we could
not start. We were a three-man crew: the <b><u>pilot</u></b> took care of
paperwork in connection with customs clearance and the flight plan, the <b><u>co-pilot
</u></b>took care of the tower and meteo, for the trip, and the <b><u>purser </u></b>served
wine and sandwiches along the way, and got a taxi at each airport we were down
about to start the plane. Once we were in the air arranged the engine with
power for the necessary functions. So I became an expert at finding willing
taxi drivers around Africa and Europe. I found, we started, and took off from
Dakar heading north, partly across the Sahara, partly across the Atlantic,
across Mauritania and Western Sahara to El Aioun, an airport about 50 km from
the coast, just inside the Canary Islands. We landed there and waited for 2
other proper small planes, which were a little slower than us, and which missed
El Aioun. Fortunately, they found an airstrip in the desert, but were out of
fuel. So a land rover was sent out with some jerry cans of jet fuel and they
arrived just before dark. so we ate together and spent the night there.</span></p>

wondered what was wrong and we explained it (I had to interpret quite a bit).
They said they would fix it. But we had to spend the night there, because it

as new, without a taxi, and we took off to fly over the Iberian Peninsula,
towards Bayonne in the South of France. As we approached Tangier on the
Mediterranean and Gibraltar the tower called us up and asked where we were
going. We answered Bayonne. They said no, out of the question, you have to
check out customs from Morocco. No, answered our pilot, we come from Kenitra.
Well, it's coming from the tower, if it doesn't turn now, we'll send our
fighters up to force you down here!!! OK replied the pilot, so we landed</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>And cleared customs etc, but it was too late to start and
cross Spain from south to north. And there is a long way between the airstrips
in the mountains of Spain or Portugal. So we spent the night in Tangier, which
was an exciting city, the short time we had there.</span></p>

line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>- The team each prepared their
tasks and today we needed a new taxi, but we got off and crossed the Strait of
Gibraltar, and further into the Spanish hinterland - the Sierra Nevada which is
not very attractive from a small plane. And suddenly the engine coughed, and
the propeller just idled.! Fortunately, we were up to 3,000 m. The co-pilot
took over and dived at full speed, got the engine jump-started, so there was
again draft in the propeller. Then I have to admit that I was a little worried,
as I looked at the hilly terrain below us. But he managed it, and it lasted all
the way to Bayonne where there was dense cloud cover and rain, after 6 days of
sun from blue skies. Again the co-pilot took over and got us to land on the
strip, on the nose wheel, then the cover there was twisted off so it rattled
like a machine gun, but we were still intact and taxied in to the hangars,
where Puibaraud was an insider, when he lived in St .Jean de Luz.</span></p>

line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>- Departure from Bayonne, with
the team in full activity. After filling up a taxi, we took off in the
direction of Rotterdam in Holland. After landing on the main strip at the main
airport there, the engine died, and the co-pilot and I had to jump out and push
the plane off the runway when the next one was a passenger plane directly
behind us. After a cleaning bucket from the management, we found a hotel and
spent the night without sightseeing.</span></p>

line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>- Problematic with a taxi on the
international side of the terminal, but we succeeded and we took off for
Denmark and Billund in Jutland, where we landed after a quiet trip without
engine problems or anything else. There I said a hearty farewell to my two
pilots, with whom I had experienced more excitement in 9 days than otherwise in
9 years!!! I found a bus to the nearest DSB station and arrived in Bjælkevangen
north of Copenhagen, to mother and father in the evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The pilot Puibaraud flew back to Paris, where he exchanged his
Cessna 206 for a larger and faster version, with two engines and propellers,
low wing. A month after we parted, he took off from Paris and after a couple of
days of flying he arrived in Dakar, took a normal front turn, but the speed and
turn radius greater than he was used to, so he crashed straight into a large
tree by the runway and was killed on the spot. I was in Norway then, and it was
a big shock to me; Even worse for his wife who was 7 months pregnant. I never
met her.</span></p>

"Comic Sans MS"'>In the meantime, Benny and Patrick had fixed the wedding for 6
August 1966 in Tromøy church, with a party at the Speiderhytta, which was (and
is) the Brinch family's summer residence. On my first visit there, to get to
know Benny's family, I was introduced to a beautiful 23-year-old diving girl,
dripping wet after an hour's swim - Benny's little sister - Ia - Inger Beate
Brinch. And thus began the second, and more serious part of my life.</span></p>

<h1><a name="_V"></a>V</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Benny and Patrick's wedding was grand, first wedding in the
small and intimate Tromøy church with all of Patrick's family and the entire
Brinch family, complete with aunts and uncles, cousins and friends from Arendal
and Alvekilen. The celebratory dinner was held at Speiderhytta. I acted as an
interpreter between the two families with Benny. The atmosphere was a little
timid at first, but when my nice new tie (un)luckily dipped into the bowl of
sauce, it created riotous laughter, and the atmosphere rose to a level
befitting a good wedding! Subsequent dancing on the pier ended with the bride
being thrown into the water by her own cousins!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The rest of the summer I saw a good deal of her little sister
Ia, who very fortunately lived just 10 minutes' walk from my grandmother's
apartment in Oslo, where I was staying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I worked a little with one of my former Danish colleagues from
Abídjan, while I was looking for something more permanent. And I was lucky,
because Trestandard was looking for an employee to sell licenses abroad. I
applied, got the job and was employed 1/1-1967 in what eventually became
Nordia, Norema after the takeover of the Enamel Works a few years later. The
job consisted of marketing licenses for the production of our products and
solutions for kitchen fittings, shop fittings, movable office walls and
laboratory fittings to 8-10 countries in Europe and later in the USA. I
eventually got to know the cabin crew at SAS well after a year of round trips
every 4 weeks which often started with Oslo-Copenhagen. The company had
subsidiaries in Denmark and Sweden, so there were quite a few trips there, but
later also to Leeds in England and Hamburg in Germany and otherwise Finland,
Ireland, Belgium, Holland, France, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Spain and
Portugal .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>On a trip to Leeds in England, in the summer of 1967, Ia wrote
in a letter to me that she would still like to get engaged with a ring!!! I was
over the moon happy and grateful and we started searching for a nest. A project
on Nesøya was very attractive, but it was too expensive for us, so we rented a
basement apartment on the best East Side in Oslo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

February 1968 in Frogner church, with a big family dinner in the evening in the
Hotel Gabelshus in Gabelsgate, not far from Brinch's apartment. The next day we
packed our winter clothes and skis and went to a mountain lodge, where we were
the only guests and got a room with bunk beds! But we enjoyed ourselves in the

a short week of ski trips, the trip went back to Oslo for work. Ia to Fürst's

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

from Skøyenparken, and a view of Oslo from the living room's panoramic window!
The following summer - 19/6-1969, Christian came into the world to the joy and
jubilation of us and the grandparents on both sides. He was baptized a few
weeks later in Tromøy church, which was the setting for Benny's wedding three
years earlier. And three years later, on 13/6-1972, Erik was born to equal
cheers and joy on all sides. However, a great sadness hit us 4 weeks later,
when Otto, my father, passed away at the age of 61 due to a heart attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>We found the apartment to be a bit cramped, with two children,
and the bedroom in a garage, converted into a bedroom. So we looked for
something bigger, preferably on the eastern edge of Oslo, where we felt
comfortable. We found Furuveien 38, which Erik and Beate now own with their two
boys Amund and Herman. We got financing from Ia's uncle at Oslo Sparebank, our
own bank, and from salesman Rein Barratt, who worked at Bergen Bank. So with
the savings from the years in Abidjan, we were able to move into our own house.
The price corresponded to 4 annual salaries of NOK 60,000 at the time. It
helped a lot that inflation was 8 – 12% per year for a </span><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>number of
years to come.</span></p>

<p class="img"><img src="./img/image001.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>So now we were homeowners with 3 bedrooms and a bathroom on
the 2nd floor, a large living room, kitchen, entrance and wc on the 1st floor,
and a cellar under the entire house. It was built in 1926 and Rein had blown
rockwool insulation into all the walls shortly before we bought it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>As mentioned before, I traveled about one week a month to our
licensees around Europe, and otherwise had to visit our factories in Jessheim
and Eggemoen to be updated on the latest technical developments, so the driving
and travel allowance was a good addition to the salary at end of the month. And
I must say that I was happy about my schooling in Denmark, where from the age
of 11 we had regular lessons in English, German, Latin and French, with the
number of hours per week increasing as we got older.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I served my military service in Norway, and since the TV
programs were rather boring, I took a correspondence course in Spanish instead,
which came in handy since we had two licensees in Spain and one in Portugal, so
I was able to maintain Cervantes' tongue as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>After 11 years with Norema, in the winter of 1977 I received a
tip that the company Anthon B Nilsen &amp; Co Ltd A/S was looking for a person
to manage an office to be set up in Sharjah, one of the 7 Emirates of the
United Arab Emirates, neighbor to Dubai. A Tjæreborg plane had crashed in the
mountains down there, and Ia remembered it, so we could find it on the map, and
she said yes, it could be exciting!</span></p>

<p class="img"><img src="./img/desert.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I traveled down in April 1978 to get to know the area and the
possibilities, with a contract for two years. I returned for summer vacation
and we all traveled down at the beginning of September for good. We were to get
housing and schooling for the boys, who were then 6 and 9 years old, and a trip
to Oslo a year for the whole family. The boys entered the International School
of Choueifat, which had students from 12-14 different nationalities, and
started in a class for students without English skills with intensive training
in English from September to December. By then they were fluent in English, and
developed a very nice, fluent Oxford English in the following years. Both boys
have expressed their unreserved joy about their stay, and the schooling at
Choueifat for the 8 years it lasted. They were both attracted to a new subject
- computer processing, with the result that they have both become software
developers at a high level after a good deal of further education in computer
science. Ia and I both worked </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>We bought a small Honda Civic for Ia, as there was no public
transport in Sharjah, and I got a Toyota 929 as a company car. After three
years and about 130,000 km it was replaced with a large Buick, which lasted
about 150,000 km and three years. It was replaced in a lightly used Mercedes
280 (the sheiks only used the cars for a year before they were replaced).
Previously we had replaced Ia's Honda with a SAAB 900 which was bought tax-free
in Gothenburg during a holiday, so we were in good driving condition, and took
both cars to Norway on our return trip in 1986.</span></p>

<p class="img"><img src="./img/middle-east.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>My job was to promote Norwegian industrial products in the UAE
and beyond in the Gulf. In the beginning it was mostly about wood fiber boards
for use in the construction industry and road construction, Norwegian Slate for
decoration and flooring, later a lot of newsprint for the new English-language
newspapers, and later for most newspapers in the Gulf, (Khaleej Times, Gulf
News, Gulf Times, Al Ittihad, and several others). I was the only resident
representative for paper mills (Norske Skog and Follum Fabrikker), so we had a
slight advantage over Finnish, Swedish and Canadian paper mills at the time. We
also represented a manufacturer of &quot;slings&quot;, What is it? There are
straps for handling bulk items in bags. For example, cement in bags of 50 kg,
which most often comes by sea. 30 sacks of 50 kg stacked in a sling becomes
1,500 kg - one and a half tonnes, which are reloaded from the boat's hold by
crane to trailers waiting on the quay for transport to construction sites
around the country. We (a Greek trader, an American trader, and I) demonstrated
the construction of &quot;slingloads&quot; both in Constanz in the Black Sea
and in Kuwait in the Gulf. The latter assignment was for Saddam Hussein, who
bought cement for his defense works against Iran. It was in the middle of
Ramadan and I do not envy the workers who worked in the hold with slingloading
in 40-45 degree heat and sun from the zenith, without water or food from
sunrise to sunset. They were all devout Muslims!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>At one point we were contacted by a Swedish engineer who had
patented a way to produce a kind of foam, which floated on the surface but
absorbed oil. Since we had an office in the Gulf, where all the oil came from,
he asked if we would consider producing this foam and blowing it into long
socks (30 cm diam x 100-200 m long) and selling them to those who needed
something like that. I got the go-ahead from ABN management and we set up a
primitive production plant, produced a warehouse and went on a sales tour around
the Gulf. First the port authorities and shipyards in the UAE, later in
Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia. We got hold of several ports and
drydocks around, but the interest eventually faded, so the matter was later put
on hold, to the great disappointment of Engineer Jan Berglund.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>After 8 very interesting years in the Gulf, both business-wise
and personally, with friends of many nationalities, both Arab, Pakistani and
European from all corners of the continent, and club activities such as golf,
which we both became very keen on (Sharjah Wanderers golf Club) where Ia was
Lady Captain for a couple of years. I was even for a time in </span><span

Church of the Seamen's Church in Dubai. </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>So when the management of ABN
after 8 years hinted that we might come home with the family, it was with
sadness, while at the same time we were prepared that one day it would have to
end. After all, I had signed up for 2 years, like most contracts in the other
offices, so we were seniors among most &quot;expats&quot; after 8 years in
Sharjah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I continued at ABN in Oslo with responsibility for the
so-called Bulk goods department - metals, paper and cellulose, together with a
couple of others. But I would still keep an eye on Sharjah, a three-week trip
every other month. This continued for four years, while Saddam Hussein fired
his Scud missiles at Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. Fortunately, the rockets could
not reach as far as the UAE with a warhead! The flights took major detours so
as not to risk contact with rockets or the like. The metal department dealt in
aluminum and copper, mainly recycled, and we were represented at the Tehran
fair (John Monn and I), but unfortunately nothing came of it, apart from a
visit to the Souk, where we were able to buy cheap saffron.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>After 6 years at ABN's head office in Oslo, we were contacted
by a young man who had an idea to produce industrial packaging based on the
principle of egg cartons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>He had already established his company Fibre-Pack. I became
involved in the project as marketing manager, traveling around markets and
fairs with a glass coffee pot wrapped in a shell made of recycled paper,
instead of Styrofoam. I tossed this glass jug around in its packaging for a few
months, until one day the packaging had had enough. But we received an inquiry
from Volvo for a packaging of one of their more delicate parts. It turned out
that they had an annual consumption of 8,000 units, and we had to invest about
NOK 30,000 in tools for this part. That would mean that at best we would pay for
the tool after 3 ½ years, without getting a penny for wages etc, so we
apologized politely. Nokia mobile phones and Electrolux vacuum cleaners were
both interested, but they too had far too small ranges for it to be profitable
for us, if we were to compete with Isopor. So we bet on &quot;saliva
trays&quot;, which all doctors' offices and hospitals use in large quantities.
The competition was fierce, and we got into a situation, after first receiving
an additional capital injection from our owners, but after 2 years of operation
the share capital was almost used up, and Morten Fleischer and I had to go the
hard way to the bankruptcy court in Tvedestrand and file for bankruptcy. Since
I was employed by Fibre-Pack and not Anton B Nilsen, I was now without work for
the first time in my life at the age of 57. Fortunately, I had attended the
Packaging School earlier in my life, and the head of the school, Yngve Krokann,
discovered that I was vacant on the square and called me with an offer of a
position as marketing manager at Con-Pack A/S in Hølen. They made plastic
packaging for the food industry. Plastic packaging: <b>&quot;ÆRSJ&quot; </b>-
I, who all my life had worked with wood fiber in one form or another....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>So I was happy that I was employed by A/S Con-Pack in Hølen,
about 50 km south of Oslo in the direction of Halden, from 1/10-94.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Con-Pack was owned and managed by Hans Kolberg, and was a
small, efficient production company with 8 employees, 5 in production and 3 in
administration and sales, so it was a bit like the conditions in Fibre-Pack,
but it was plastic after all.. .. Our products were vacuum-shaped bowls and
troughs for the food industry, mainly in Norway, but also a little in Sweden to
pack sausages, pate, chocolate and other food products. The different forms
were produced in series of thousands, packed in cartons and picked up by the
customers. My task was to find new customers or food producers, who bought from
others, or who had just started up. It would be best if we could use some of
our existing molds, because (like Fibre-Pack) new tools were expensive. This
created some internal discussions about whether to invest or drop the project.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>There was a lot of driving around Norway, from Kristianssand /
Stavanger in the south to the north of Trondheim, both along the coast and far
in towards the border with Sweden. It paid well with a driving allowance. Ia
worked since 1994, after we returned home from Sharjah, at the Canadian Embassy
as a secretary. We had sold the SAAB, but kept the Merc. The 100 km daily t/r
Hølen drank a lot of high-octane petrol - 12, -13 liters per day. One day I was
invited to join a visit near Stockholm and we drove my colleague's Citroën
Xantia diesel. It went 1000 km on the tank, which was half the size of the tank
on my Merc! It convinced me that it was time to change the car! The savings on
fuel amply paid for the financing of the new car in two years, and since then
there was money right in the pocket. After three years at Con-Pack, Kolberg
wanted to sell the company to a company in Brumundal, and I did not want to be
there and resigned as of 31/5-1997. So then I was once again unemployed, after
three interesting and instructive years in Hølen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I was now 59 years old, so I was wondering if there was a job
available for an old hunk of junk like me. Ole Ree, Ia's cousin, was in the
process of establishing a so-called &quot;Call Centre&quot; at Flisa, which I
knew from my stay at the Osen Practical Forestry School in 1958 - 40 years
earlier. Ole needed a manager of this call center and asked if I would be
involved, some time before I found something permanent. It was a completely new
field for me, but it was paid work, so I said yes. It was with Ia's cousin. I
had no idea what was going to happen, but spent the weekdays at Flisa (got
tired of Pizza after a few weeks) and the weekends in Oslo. It was an exciting
six months from July to November 1997, when a whole new world opened up for me.
For me, a phone was a phone you called to talk to a person. Yes, you learn as
long as you are curious! The call center was established with the telecom
operator One Call, and it was almost operational before I got a new job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I even had the Packaging School to thank for a new job offer.
The school competed together with the newly established Materialretur A/S at
Skøyen in Oslo. They were looking for a mature marketing manager, with
experience from the packaging sector. I visited them, they were three
employees, daily manager Dag Kirchoff, a Finnish organizational manager Jaana
Røine, who today is Adm. Dir. in the company and Hilde Lieng who was secretary.
So I was number 4, and started at the end of November 1997.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>This time the work consisted of selling membership in
packaging recycling, Materialretur A/S, which was later renamed Grønt Punkt
Norge A/S. The member companies, which mainly consist of industrial and
commercial companies that package their products, and that pay to Materialretur
an amount per unit, which guarantees that this packaging is collected and
recycled. The company then has the opportunity to label its packaging with the
&quot;Green Dot&quot; label. It was quite challenging in the beginning to
convince industry leaders that their membership was in their own interest, and
necessary. Materialretur is owned by the manufacturers of corrugated cardboard,
milk cartons and other cartons, plastic manufacturers, glass and metal
packaging. We quickly gained more employees as the number of members grew, and
as the industry became more and more environmentally conscious. It did not
happen without help from the authorities. We had a very nice working
environment, so it was 7 very interesting and rewarding years until May 2005,
when I reached the age limit and became a pensioner. By then we had 14
employees, and now in 2021 they have become 22, and I wish them all the best in
the future. It was the end of a working life from 1957 to 2005 - (48 years)
which is now history, with great variations in tasks, environments, industries,
workplaces etc. I have never dreaded going to work, and consider myself very
lucky boy!!!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Ia and I had already in the year 2000 started thinking about
where and what we should spend the autumn of life with? Ia's sister, whom I had
known since the time in Africa, was still married to her Patrick and they lived
in the Loire Valley in France, where we had spent many wonderful holidays.
Therefore, France was more tempting than Spain, where we had permanent
Norwegian friends, but we were a little afraid of getting into a clique
environment that we have read and heard about, from foreign holiday countries.</span></p>

us on a trip to the South of France, to his brother in Montpellier, and further
down to the Spanish border at Collioure on the Mediterranean. It was the middle
of the wine harvest, and we watched with amazement the grape picking on the <u>very
</u>steep vineyards. It was something other than the vineyards in the Loire
Valley! Once back at Baulay we thought that, yes, it was tempting to explore
further.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>In October 2001, Vestheim Rotary Club carried out a trip to
Southern France - Provence. It was an intense program of </span><span

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>to
vineyards, historical monuments, Vaison la Romaine, which was severely flooded
in 1995. Almost all capitals in Europe, including Oslo, had given a block of
their local character to the city, with an inscription, as evidence of an
economic support for the reconstruction of the city. We had been tasked with
delivering the check from Oslo Municipality. This trip with good friends was
another life-giving injection with the thought of our plans for settling in the
South of France.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>In December 2001 we traveled back to the South of France, all
alone! We were based in Nebian, a small village slightly in the hinterland,
about 40 km from the coast, for a short two-week exploration of what is called
&quot;La Plaine Biterroise&quot; (the Beziers plain). We visited 28 villages and
a couple of towns but didn't find what we wanted. We even had to scrape ice off
the car one morning, but that didn't scare us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>We traveled back the same year (2002) and visited a further 30
villages in the 14 days we were there. No. 27 in the series was Cazouls les
Beziers, on a Thursday. We returned on Sunday to join a guided tour of the
village with a historian. Ended with an aperitif with the area's cured meats
and wines on the market square. All free. That's when we looked at each other
and nodded!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The following Tuesday we returned and asked the estate agent
if he had any houses to sell in the village. He answered yes, he had a house,
and from the pictures it was a good house. He arranged a visit to the owner the
same day, and we fell head over heels for the house, the garden and the
swimming pool!</span></p>

<p class="img"><img src="./img/image004.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Thursday 26/9 – 2002 we signed a purchase contract for
€176,300. The seller was Bernard Martin, who was president of both the Tourist
Office and the Artists' Association and a member of the city council. And he
became the first of many good friends in the village, over the years. He asked
to stay in the house for a year. It was all right, because we couldn't move
until 2005. He organized the rental for 2003-2004 to a nice couple who built
their own house, and who lived quite far away. On the way home we stopped by
Benny and Patrick to show off our new acquisition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>In May we traveled down to formally take over the house from
the notary, who thought I was already retired. It was corrected! I had visited
the Rotary Club in Beziers, so we were invited to join in the wine harvest with
one of the members who was a wine farmer. It was a memorable Sunday, finished
with a truffle omelette and plenty of wine! The president drove into the ditch
on the way out of the property. In the summer of 2004 we visited our tenants,
and I made a short trip to Cazouls in July 2005 to take possession of the glory
and to order a car – a red Citroên C4! I happened to be accompanied by Ronald,
a Rotary friend from Vestheim who was going down to watch the Tour de France
which was passing through the area at the time. The tenants had generously left
two beds and a table with folding chairs, so I could invite Ronald to spend the
night, as the very first guest in our new house. I took the opportunity to
visit the Rotary Club in Beziers, and the Tourist Office in Cazouls, where I
was invited to participate in the municipality's 14 July celebration at the
stadium. There, Yvette from the Tourist Office had seated me at a table with
the entire foreign resident clan and some &quot;migratory birds&quot; with
holiday homes in Cazouls. It was a mix of English, Scottish, Dutch, and a
Canadian, so the mood grew high as the evening progressed. Various starters,
the main course was roast beef on a skewer in front of the entire population!
And plenty of drinks, sangria and wine. Everything is free, but you have to pay
for water!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>I was accompanied home by an English/Dutch couple, and they
asked if they could have some of the giant lavender plants that invaded the
swimming pool. I was happy, because they covered half the surface of the water.
And they returned home with the trunk full of lavender</span></p>

Furuveien 38 to Recphares 4! We packed our belongings into boxes with the help
of the new owners of the F 38 - Beate and Erik. Thank you very much for the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

and it all got a place either in the garage (the boxes) or in the house
(furniture etc.) with the good help of the driver and his wife. The Citroën had
already been delivered, so I could guide the moving van the last bit to
Recphares,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>The first weeks were spent getting everything in place. Much
was placed in the garage. Eventually we met some of the English residents, and
a pleasant friendship developed with everyone. &lt;the case would be that all
of us 5-6 couples or families had found Cazouls between 2002 and 2004, and had
found houses within a circle of 5-600 m. And everyone, including ourselves,
thought that here we came to a &quot;back country ” village with only frenchmen
! There were about 4,200 of them.</span></p>

<p class="img"><img src="./img/image009.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>One day in April, Bernard (former owner of the house) came to
visit and asked if we wanted to come down to the artists' association's spring
exhibition. He was president of the same association. We accepted, and visited
the exhibition which had around fifty exhibitors from, Cazouls and from
surrounding villages and towns. The art painting professional asked if I wanted
to join the association to participate in the weekly courses for 10-12 other
amateur painters. So that was the first step into French society. Ia soon
became involved in the mosaic group, and in the pottery group and finally in
silk painting, all with weekly meetings, so the week was soon packed, and all
the other participants were French, so there was also intense training in
French for both of us. I was able to transfer my membership in Rotary from
Vestheim in Oslo to Rotary Club Beziers Sud and thereby gained approx. 40 new
French friends, and even a weekly meeting. In autumn 2006, the incoming
president of the Rotary Club said that for business reasons he could not take up
the post as planned. After many inquiries among the club's experienced members,
I was asked as a former president of Vestheim if I could take on the position.
I pointed to my short stay and membership in the club, but they completely
ignored that, so suddenly I got the job as president from 1/7-2007 for a year.
Fortunately, I had a board of experienced Rotarians so I had an eventful rotary
year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>However, Ia and I still had time for some sightseeing around
Languedoc, which has a very interesting history that stretches back to
pre-Roman times, to the 4th century, when the Nordic Visigoths slowly flooded
through the area and further down into Spain. They left the Nordic countries
around 100 AD. And moved with all the cattle from 30 - 100 km per year south through
Europe, integrated all the way into the local population, except in Rome, which
they defeated in about 400, before coming here, and continued further down into
Spain. The Romans came in full force and they left a lasting mark. The name
Cazouls comes from the word Casa, which denoted a large farm - lord's seat,
which was given to a Roman officer who had made a positive mark, and the name
of the place became the name of the village that grew up around the lord's
seat. We have a small part of the Via Domitia a couple of km from Cazouls,
where you can clearly see the tracks in the mountain bed, worn down by the
Roman chariots, It is part of the army road from Rome to Madrid! 1,500 – 1,600
km of paved road to facilitate the Roman armies in their job of building up the
Roman Empire. You become quite reverent when you can stick your fingers down
and feel the wheel tracks that are almost 2,000 years old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Otherwise, there are many other attractions, such as
amphitheatres, a number of museums with a wealth of household utensils,
statues, weapons and more. The amphitheaters are today used for concerts and
theater performances in the summer, in Nimes, Arles and Orange, among others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>We had planned to play a lot of golf now that we were retired,
on the many golf courses in the area. We tried two or three courses and mostly
fell for the course in Lamalou les Bains, a nine-hole course about 25 km from
Cazouls, and we played a lot there. But all our activities in the village
occupied us so much that it didn't turn out what we had planned. However, I
played with Erik when they were here, and with Brian Wilson, one of the
&quot;migratory bird&quot; friends from England. And now in the Covid-19 times,
nothing has come of it since the end of 2019m and the form is not the same as
it was a few years ago. Some of our friends from the painting club invited us
to join the Friends of the Organ, which organizes concerts in the church to
support the maintenance of the fine 175-year-old organ. Here Ia became deputy
secretary after a few years, and I later secretary and in 2019 president for a
year, until the Culture Commission in la Mairie took over. And since then it
has been quiet because of Covid!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>One thing led to another, And during a festival in 2009 in the
village, &quot;les Treilles Cazoulines&quot; asked the folk dance association
if I would like to dance folk dance and it was and is a fun and physically
demanding hobby. Later I became a member (only enjoying) of Degustateurs
d'Enserune, wine tasting once or twice a month. Already in 2006, we foreigners
were asked if we wanted to join FNACA, the veterans' association from the
Algiers War, to be a flag bearer on 8 May, the peace of 1945, 23 August, which
is the liberation of Beziers in 1944, and 11 November, which is the peace
agreement after the First World War in 1918. And we were all honoured, so now
there is a flag castle with flags from England, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark and
Norway plus France on these occasions. All the festivities end in the town hall
square with the playing of la Marseillaisen and in the Salle polyvalente with
snacks and wines with and without bubbles. All paid for by the municipality!</span></p>

<p class="img"><img src="./img/image003.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Our good friends, Norwegian Terje and Irish Geraldine, were
members of la &quot;Confrerie de Chantegosiers&quot; in Tautavel near Perpignan
and asked if we would like to join them. It was an association to support and
spread the good wines from Tautavel, so we wanted to and have since celebrated
Ia's birthdays at their annual reception ceremony, which is held at the end of
March. And this led to a membership in la &quot;Conferie de Gosiers secs&quot;
in Vaux en Beaujolais, also called &quot;Clochemerle&quot; after a novel about
a mayor and a priest who could not agree on the location of a urinal in the
village. It now stands on the square in the village, where the annual reception
meeting and party is held.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>In April 2012, we joined Fay and Christian on a three-week
tour of China. Just the 4 of us by plane via Oslo to Pekin (the northern city).
All transport otherwise took place by bus, train or metro. We visited the
traditional sights in Beijing: the Forbidden City, Tian An Men Square, the
Summer Palace, the Great Wall of China, which Christian's student friend Robert
had walked along! (6,000 km) in 18 months. a few years before. We took the
night train to Rizhao, about 700 km south of Beijing, on the coast, and a bus
to Fay's birthplace Lin Pie, a charming little village. about 100 km from the
coast, where we spent four days visiting the sisters' properties, with lunches
with sticks, and some Chinese beer and local spirits and nice walks through
tobacco plantations, spring onion fields and peanut farms, which are the basis
of their cooking oil, such as olive oil here in Europe. They had raised pigs,
so it was a versatile use. We also greeted Fay's 5 older sisters. One lived in
Beijing, whom we also met there, the other two were married to farmers in the
area. Also greeted Papa Chen (83), who was a widower 10 years prior, lived and
looked after himself in the village, and came to visit on his three-wheeled
bicycle with a loading platform on the back! It was an experience to meet Fay's
family, and to be so warmly received by Christian's brothers-in-law and
sisters-in-law. And all meals with locally made spirits, beer and taken with
sticks. And no one knew a word of English, except a cousin of Fay's, who came
to visit. We got a huge bedroom, with a <u>very </u>hard bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>After four days we returned to Rizhao where we strolled along
the beach where Fay and Christian had their engagement photos taken a couple of
years earlier. It is a local tradition that is very popular. We continued to
Qufu which is the birthplace of Confucius in 551 BC. His university and one of
his 550 temples are here, and the Chinese honor his memory by burning fragrant
twigs. He was finance minister under the local emperor, but they fell out and
Confucius went on a preaching journey of many thousands of km throughout China
to spread his philosophy, which to this day characterizes many of the countries
of the East.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>We went further south to Nanjing (the southern city) where Dr.
Sun Yatsen founded the first Chinese Republic in 1912, until the Japanese
occupied the city.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

Princess Leizu, the emperor's concubine!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>We visited a silk spinning factory, and saw the production
from cocoon to finished thread and on to products such as shawls, duvets and
everything you can imagine. We bought two silk duvets which are used with great
pleasure by us in Cazouls in the summer. The neighboring business was a
printing house, where we saw color-printed silk cloths, dated 300 BC! Clear
colors and sharp contours. Fantastic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Then came the trip to Shanghai (the city by the sea) where Fay
had booked us into the familiar Hanting Hotel, a chain of 996 hotels in China.
All rooms were dead the same. We stayed at 6 of them. The room is rectangular,
bathroom and toilet in a square room built into the large room, with a <u>glass
wall </u>facing the bedroom! One could monitor the partner's visit to the
throne! The hotel in Shanghai was right next to 'The Bunt' the famous
promenade along the coast with all the luxury hotels, so we were very impressed
with the location. I celebrated my 74th birthday with a delicious lunch right
under the Shanghai TV Tower, which we had visited in the morning. Viewing
platform 250 m above street level, with a glass floor, so there was a strong
sucking feeling in the gut when admiring the view. Later we saw the
Contemporary Art Museum and the next day we continued by train to Wuhan, which
is now quite famous for the emergence of the Corona virus. But we were there 8
years before! There Fay had her aunt Daoxiu, and we met her husband who was a
painter, Ang Zhong. Fay went on to university in Beijing, and was recommended
to study further in Oslo! And there Fay and Christian met each other and sweet
Chinese and Norwegian music arose in their hearts! We visited Ang Zhong's home
and admired his large paintings - 1 x 2 m traditional Chinese landscape
painting, and got a book with his exhibitions etc. He is known for his
landscapes of the Yangtze River and the Three Gorges. We also visited the Wuhan
National Museum where they had i.a. the skull of the Yunxian man – 900,000
years old ! It is twice as old as &quot;l'homme de Tautavel&quot; here in the
South of France. And the same English archaeologist who took part in the
excavations in both places.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>We ended the three-week experience trip with another visit to
Beijing with a visit to the 798 Contemporary Art Center. It was built into one
of East Germany's factory buildings from long before the wall fell (the one in
Germany - the Chinese one still stands). It is huge, very versatile, from
handicraft work to &quot;Road drum among apples&quot; And as a cultural finale,
we visited The Heavenly Garden, which also honored Confucius, before we flew
home to Oslo via Helsinki on 24 April.</span></p>

During the Christmas holidays 2013, Fay and Christian came for a very nice

and a visit to the doctor led to a scan at the hospital, where it was
established that she had a cancerous tumor in the colon, and that it could not
be operated on yet. The doctor did not mind at all that we traveled to Prague
and wished us a happy New Year's celebration. In February, Ia received her
first series of 6 chemotherapy treatments over two weeks. I had to travel to
Canada to participate in my brother Olav's funeral (age 72 </span><span

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Comic Sans MS"'>, which
was held in the Norwegian sailor's church in Montreal. His children had asked
me to scatter the ashes on the St. Lawrence river, according to Olav's own
wishes. It happened from a real sailboat that Christopher had hired for the
day. Ia was still undergoing the first chemotherapy treatment when I returned.
She became weaker after a while, and when Erik arrived at the end of April we
had to call for emergency help and she was admitted to the hospital in Beziers
for a scan. It showed that she had a metastasis in her brain, which required
surgery. The operation on 26/4 in Montpellier went quickly and very well so
after a few days of recovery she was transferred to the Clinique Coste Floret
in Lamalou les Bains, a center for post-operative care, where she remained for
well over a month, recovering wonderfully. Many of our friends from Cazouls and
Beziers visited to cheer her up. In the time after discharge from Coste Floret
and until October, she was back and forth between home and Montpellier for
chemotherapy and a brain scan to check that the brain was free of metastasis.
And that was it. It was a quiet Christmas celebration, but we had a visit from
Bitten Nouri, Benny's Swedish friend from Tunis, who was a nurse, and she
stayed here until it was over, and was a great help. The local nurses said she
was so good they wanted to adopt her. Erik and his family were here in
mid-January, and Christian and his family came three days before Ia died, and
Erik came and stayed for the funeral. It was solemnized in our local church
with a couple of hundred of our friends from the village and from Beziers,
followed by &quot;le verre d'amitie&quot; with a buffet, organized by our
English friends.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Comic Sans MS"'>Since my years in the scout movement and as a logger, I have
always been environmentally conscious, and it was not long after our arrival
before we installed 15 solar panels for the production of electricity for sale
to our local &quot;Regie Municipale d'Électricité et Eau&quot; a municipal
enterprise. It became active from May 2008 and has since brought us between NOK
15 and 20,000 per year, since we get about 5 times as much for our production
as we pay for what we buy. It should be said that here in the area the sun
shines about 300 days a year. Around 2015, I was contacted by someone who sold
panels for &quot;auto-consumption&quot;, thereby reducing their own
consumption. It was interesting, as the price of electricity was expected to
rise by around 5% per year in the future. So I invested in panels and batteries,
to be able to store a certain amount of surplus production for use at night.
One thing led to the other, and today the house is covered with 17 panels for
sale, and 19 for own consumption, so now I am self-sufficient with from 15 to
25% self-produced electricity on an annual basis, plus the sale of electricity
to la Régie covers the electricity bill by the way.</span></p>

court. There were several options for me, and the easiest and safest was to
transfer the property to Ia's and my heirs, and stay at &quot;Jouissance&quot;
myself - i.e. I live for free in the house that the boys cannot sell until I
